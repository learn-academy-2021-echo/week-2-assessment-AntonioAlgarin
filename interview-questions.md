# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is what is expected to be passed to a function. An argument is the condition that must be met.

  Researched answer: There are many times of parameters and functions aren't limited to input parameters, they can also list an output parameter as well. Parameters are essentially place holders. Parameters are different from arguments because an argument is the actual data you give to the function. You must include a parameter in the function to give the function an argument. An argument can be any data type that's recognized by the language you are using.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The three parameters that .map() takes are value, index, and array. The required parameter is the "value" parameter. Both index and array are optional.

  Researched answer: The array parameter is the specific array in which the .map() method is being called upon.



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is assigning specific values in the object, to their own individual variables.

  Researched answer: When destructuring an object, the name of the variable that is assigned to the value, must match the name of the value in the object. This helps developers save time whenever they need to access values in complex objects.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is a set of instructions performed on a set of parameters. You can create many different types of functions capable of performing many different tasks. You can also specify how many parameters you want the function to take.

  A method is a type of function that has already been preassigned a set of instructions by other developers. Because of how often they're used, methods were created to reduce redundant code. This allows the code to be more efficient and easier to read and understand.

  Researched answer: Methods are properties of objects. Methods have fixed names that have been predefined while functions are created and named by the developer. Another difference is that methods are limited to the data type for which they were created while functions can work with any data type as specified by the developer.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a "blue print" for an object. This means that a class is an object which is meant to be used numerous times, with variation. You have the option to keep values in a class as "fixed values" or set some up to be flexible and change.

  An object is created to carry the values and keys that were originally assigned to it. You have the ability to reassign, add, or remove values in an object, but objects are not designed to be changed.

  Researched answer: An important characteristic to keep in mind when distinguishing between a class and an object is that classes do not need to take up memory like objects do. Because memory is not allocated to a class, they are not able to be manipulated like objects can.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I believe this is when the computer takes assigned variables and "hoists" them to the top of the page.

  Researched answer: Hoisting allows the interpreter to be more aware of the function, class, or variable before it gets declared.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: This is the ability to inherit methods from a previously created class.

2. React: React is a library of reusable and commonly used "components".

3. React state: State is used to determine if a react component is a logic component or a display component. If the component holds data, it's considered a logic component.

4. React lifecycle methods: React components have a three phase lifecycle. The three phases of the lifecycle are mounting, updating, unmounting.

5. DOM: This is where components are mounted and unmounted from.
